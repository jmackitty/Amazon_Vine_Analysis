# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
A client requested analytics on their product reviews verses their competitor's product reviews because they are about to release a catalog of products on a leading retail website. Some companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The purpose of this analysis was to to determine if it is worth it for them to enroll in this paid program. In this project, we determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

## Summary:

* There are a total of 497 paid reviews in the data set used.

## Summary: 

Based on the results of the data, there is no positive bias in the product reviews. There were a higher percentage of 5-star ratings for non-Vine reviewers at around 62%, and the Vine reviewers only gave 5-stars around 44% of the time.  We could test additional product reviews to see if there are similar results to confirm that there is no positivity bias with the reviews.
